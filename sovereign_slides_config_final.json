      "content": "The framework incorporates 13 key macroeconomic indicators with theory-driven transformations. Each variable undergoes specific processing to capture economic relationships and ensure model stability.\n\n**Variables Using Log Return Transformation:**\n• Commodity Index - captures price volatility cycles\n• Debt to GDP - ensures stationarity for fiscal ratios\n• Equity Index - captures market risk dynamics\n• Exchange Rate (FX) - reflects currency depreciation risk\n• GDP - captures economic growth momentum\n• Government Consumption - tracks fiscal policy changes\n• Inflation Rate - monetary policy transmission mechanism\n• Oil Price - commodity price shock impact\n• Unemployment Rate - labor market conditions\n\n**Variables Using Difference Transformation:**\n• Government 10Y Bond Rate - interest rate level changes\n• Monetary Policy Rate - central bank policy adjustments\n• Net Exports - trade balance fluctuations\n• Term Spread - yield curve slope changes\n\n**Transformation Benefits:**\n• Ensures stationarity for time series modeling\n• Captures economic theory-consistent relationships\n• Standardizes variables for cross-country analysis"

      "content": "The Optimal Variable Selection process employs comprehensive rules to ensure economically meaningful and statistically robust models. These constraints balance theoretical expectations with empirical evidence.\n\n**Economic Sign Constraints:**\n• Positive Impact Variables:\n  - Debt to GDP ratio (higher debt increases default risk)\n  - Unemployment rate (economic weakness signal)\n• Negative Impact Variables:\n  - Commodity prices (resource revenue protection)\n  - Equity index (market confidence indicator)\n  - GDP growth (economic strength measure)\n  - Oil prices (commodity exporters benefit)\n• Flexible Variables:\n  - Exchange rates and interest rates (context-dependent)\n\n**Statistical Filters:**\n• Maximum correlation threshold: 0.8 (multicollinearity control)\n• P-value significance: ≤ 0.15 (statistical relevance)\n• Variable significance testing with coefficient stability\n\n**Model Architecture Rules:**\n• Maximum 4 macroeconomic variables per model\n• Lag structure: 0 to 4 quarters for dynamic relationships\n• Single-use constraint: one transformation per base variable\n• Required fixed variables: lagged dependent variable for mean reversion"
